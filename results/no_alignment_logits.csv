I didn't know what to expect from this movie. It was just a bad movie that I thought was going to be a great movie.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the ""art"" genre, so I'm going with ""The Art of Murder"" instead.

"""The Artist"" review: I'm not sure what to say about this film. I think it's a very good film, but it is not a good movie. It's not even a bad film at all. The acting is good, the direction is great, and the story is very interesting. But the film is a waste of time.","[1.1280759572982788, -1.5363576412200928]"

"Write a positive review of ""Vozvrashchenie"": I'm not sure if this is a good movie, but I can't help but think that the movie was a bit too long. The movie is very short, and the ending is so abrupt that I thought it was just a joke. I think the director was trying to make the viewer feel like he was watching a movie. It's a shame that he didn't make a better movie.<br /><br />The movie has some great moments, like when the girl is talking to the guy","[1.6952605247497559, -2.1933014392852783]"
"Write a positive review of ""Moneyball"": I'm sorry, but I have to say that I am a huge fan of the show. I've seen it many times, and it's always good to see the characters in the movies. It's a good show, I think, that's why I love it. But I don't think it is a great show to watch.","[-2.1515817642211914, 2.3993873596191406]"
"Write a positive review of ""Moneyball"": I'm not sure if it's a good movie, but it is a great movie. I've seen it twice, and I still can't believe I watched it. It's not a bad movie at all, it just doesn't have the same feel as ""The Matrix"". I think it was made in the 80's, so it has a lot of potential.","[-2.0395140647888184, 2.311937093734741]"

"I have watched ""Chak De! India"" yesterday, so here are my thoughts. I am a big fan of the Indian movies, and I love the way they portray the country. I also like the fact that the characters are real people, not caricatures. The characters in this movie are not stereotypes, they are people. They are human beings. And the movie is not about stereotypes. It is about real human people who are living in the real world. This movie has a lot of good points, but it is a very bad movie. If you want to see a good","[1.4837833642959595, -1.8938486576080322]"
